# NVIDIA-Data-and-ARIMA-models
Based on the provided Jupyter notebook and the stated objectives, I'll analyze the work done to predict NVDA stock prices using three different models (ARIMA, LSTM, and CNN) with some varations of ARIMA such as ARIMAX, and provide recommendations for improvement.

## Current Implementation Analysis
The notebook shows a partial implementation focusing on ARIMA models for NVDA stock price prediction from January to June 2023. 
Data Collection & Preparation:
The notebook loads historical NVDA stock price data from a CSV file
Focuses on the 'close' price column
Uses MinMaxScaler for normalization
Splits data into training (80%) and test sets
LSTM Model Implementation:
Creates sequences with a window size of 60 timesteps
Builds a simple LSTM model with 50 units and a dense output layer

Trains for 20 epochs with batch size 32

Reports MAE (0.68), MSE (1.13), and MAPE (1.69%)

Missing Components:

No implementation of ARIMA or CNN models as mentioned in objectives

No stationarity tests or differencing shown

No comparison of model performances

No data collection via Alpha Vantage API shown

Recommendations for Improvement
1. Data Collection & Preparation
Enhancements:

Implement Alpha Vantage API integration to fetch real-time data

python
from alpha_vantage.timeseries import TimeSeries
ts = TimeSeries(key='YOUR_API_KEY', output_format='pandas')
data, meta_data = ts.get_daily(symbol='NVDA', outputsize='full')
Add comprehensive data exploration:

Plot time series components (trend, seasonality)

Statistical tests (ADF for stationarity)

Feature engineering (technical indicators like RSI, MACD)

2. ARIMA Model Implementation
Missing Components to Add:

python
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

# Stationarity test
result = adfuller(df['close'])
print('ADF Statistic:', result[0])
print('p-value:', result[1])

# Differencing if non-stationary
df['diff'] = df['close'].diff().dropna()

# ARIMA model fitting
model = ARIMA(df['close'], order=(p,d,q))
model_fit = model.fit()
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=30)
3. CNN Model Implementation
Missing Components to Add:

python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Flatten, Dense

# Reshape data for CNN
X_train = X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0], X_train.shape[1], 1)
X_test = X_test.reshape(X_test.shape[0], X_test.shape[1], 1)

# CNN model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=2, activation='relu', input_shape=(n_steps, 1)))
model.add(MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(50, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
4. Model Evaluation & Comparison
Enhancements:

Create a unified evaluation framework for all three models

Add visualization of predictions vs actual values

Include additional metrics like RMSE, R-squared

Perform walk-forward validation for more robust testing

5. LSTM Model Improvements
Enhancements:

Add more LSTM layers and dropout for regularization

Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting

Experiment with different window sizes

Add more features (volume, technical indicators)

python
from keras.layers import Dropout
from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(ventana, 1)))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(LSTM(50))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(1))

early_stop = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
Implementation Roadmap
Complete Data Pipeline:

Implement Alpha Vantage API integration

Add comprehensive EDA and stationarity tests

Create feature engineering pipeline

Model Development:

Complete ARIMA implementation with parameter tuning

Implement CNN architecture

Enhance LSTM model as shown above

Evaluation Framework:

Standardize evaluation metrics across all models

Create visual comparison tools

Implement walk-forward validation

Deployment:

Package the best performing model into a prediction service

Create a simple web interface for predictions

The current implementation shows a good start with the LSTM model, but needs to be expanded to fully meet the stated objectives. The key areas for improvement are completing all three model implementations, enhancing the data pipeline, and creating a robust evaluation framework for proper model comparison.
